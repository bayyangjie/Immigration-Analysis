# Immigration-Analysis


## Background

Migration has grown steadily in recent decades with more than 280 million proplr ot 3.6% of the world's population being international migrants. Often people move and take their religion with them, contributing to gradual changes in their new country’s religious makeup. Sometimes, though, migrants shed the religion they grew up with and adopt their new host country’s majority religion, some other religion or no religion. This study is an exploratory analysis aimed at understanding the religious composition of global immigrants from 1990 to 2020. 

 ## Objectives
- Studies the proportion of immigrants from each region throughout the years which includes both incoming and outgoing immigrants from the country
- Analyze the proportion of religions that make up the global immigration population in the dataset to understand the spread of immigrant count among the different religions globally
- Understand the growth profile of global immigration from 1990 to 2020
