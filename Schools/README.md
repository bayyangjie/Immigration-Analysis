## Project Insights
- Amongst all the zones, the North zone has the most number of schools while the other thre zones each have almost the same number schools.
- Primary and Secondary schools make up the bulk of schools in Singapore. Narrowing down the findings, we can also infer the following from the visualization "Education Types per Zone":
  - East has the highest number of primary schools
  - North has the highest number of secondary schools.
  - For Junior Colleges, the number of schools are almost the same across all zones
  - For the mixed levels education, South has the most number of schools with 5.
- Most of the government schools are located in the North followed by the West. On the other hand, government-aided schools are mostly located in the South followed by the East.
- Narrowing down to the nature types of each school type, we can see that government schools (government and government-aided) are mostly co-ed while independent, specialised independent and specialised schools are only either co-ed or girls' school. The number of girls' schools and co-ed schools are the same in all three school types.
